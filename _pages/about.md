I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Finance and Risk Engineering Department](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/finance-and-risk-engineering) of NYU, supervised by Professor [Nizar Touzi](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~touzi/). Before that, I earned my ingénieur degree (M.S. level) in Applied Mathematics from [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) and my B.S. in Mathematics from the Chu Kochen Honors College at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). My research focuses on principal–agent problems, with additional interests in mean-field games and the signature method.
